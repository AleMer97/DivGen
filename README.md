# DivGen

This is the repository for Alexandre Mercier's Master Thesis Project in Informatics at the Technical University Munich ([TUM](https://www.tum.de)) under supervision of the [SEBIS](https://wwwmatthes.in.tum.de) chair.

# Project Goal

The project aims to research and develop approaches to generate diverse and high-quality descriptions for online platforms/markets starting from structured data.
We concentrate on a music platform and thus generate band descriptions. Our experiment focus on ways to influence and maximize form diversity in the text.


# Getting Started 

The dataset we used is not public. Instead we provide query templates to build one own's dataset as well as a small synthetic dataset.

## Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Used to access GPT3.5 and GPT4
  
> Requirements: Python 3.9

Open `main.ipynb` to step through the experiments.
