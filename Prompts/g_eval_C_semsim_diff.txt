You will be given two descriptions written for two different bands or djs.

Your task is to rate the descriptions on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Semantic similarity (1-10) - how closely related or similar two pieces of text or concepts are in terms of their meaning or semantics.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read both descriptions for the band or DJ to understand their content and context.
2. Compare the content in terms of how closely related or similar the concepts, ideas, and information are between the two descriptions.
3. Rate the semantic similarity on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 indicating very low similarity (highly dissimilar) and 10 indicating very high similarity (almost identical in terms of meaning and semantics).
4. Consider factors like word choice, thematic relevance, and contextual understanding when determining the semantic similarity.
5. Provide a justified rating that reflects the degree of similarity in meaning and semantics between the two descriptions.
